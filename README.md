#AimBrain SDK integration

## Application class
In order to integrate the AimBrain iOS SDK it is necessary to set up `AMBNCapturingApplication` (subclass of `UIApplication`) as main application. `main.m` file after modification should look like this:

```objective_c
@import UIKit;
#import "MyAppDelegate.h"
#import "AMBNCapturingApplication.h"

int main(int argc, char * argv[])
{
    @autoreleasepool {
        return UIApplicationMain(argc, argv, NSStringFromClass([AMBNCapturingApplication class]), NSStringFromClass([MyAppDelegate class]));
    }
}
```

## API Authentication
In order to communicate with the server, the application must be configured with a valid API Key and secret. Relevant configuration parameters should be passed to the SDK using the `AMBNManager`â€™s `configureWithApplicationId:secret` method. Most often the best place for it is  `application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions` of app delegate.

```objective_c
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
    [[AMBNManager sharedInstance] configureWithApplicationId:@"test" secret:@"secret"];
    return YES;
}
```

## Registering views
The more views have identifiers assigned, the more accurate the analysis can be made. Views can be registered using `registerView:withId` method of `AMBNManager`

```objective_c
- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];

    [[AMBNManager sharedInstance] registerView:self.view withId:@"sign-in-vc"];
    [[AMBNManager sharedInstance] registerView:self.emailTextField withId:@"email-text-field"];
    [[AMBNManager sharedInstance] registerView:self.pinTextField withId:@"pin-text-field"];
    [[AMBNManager sharedInstance] registerView:self.wrongPINLabel withId:@"pin-label"];
}
```



## Starting collection
In order to start collecting behavioural data `start` method needs to be called on `AMBNManager`

```objective_c
[[AMBNManager sharedInstance] start];
```


## Session
In order to submit behavioural data to AimBrain `AMBNManager` needs to be configured with a session. There are two ways of doing it.

### Obtaining new session
A new session can be obtained by passing `userId` to `createSession` method on `AMBNManager`.

```objective_c
[[AMBNManager sharedInstance] createSessionWithUserId:userId completion:^(NSString *session, NSError *error) {
    if(session){
        //Do something after successful session creation
    }
}];
```

The manager is automatically configured with the obtained session ID.

### Configuring with existing session
A session can be stored and later used to configure `AMBNManager`.

```objective_c
[AMBNManager sharedInstance].session = storedSession
```

## Submitting behavioural data
After the manager is configured with a session, behavioural data can be submitted.

```objective_c
-(void) submitBehaviouralData {
    [[AMBNManager sharedInstance] submitBehaviouralDataWithCompletion:^(AMBNResult *result, NSError *error) {
        NSNumber * score = result.score;
        //Do something with obtained score
    }];
}
```

Server responds to data submission with the current behavioural score and status.

### Periodic submission
In order to schedule periodic submission use the following snippet:

```objective_c
// Call this method after the session ID is obtained
- (void) startPeriodicUpdate {
   self.timer = [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:10.0f target: self selector:@selector(submitBehaviouralData) userInfo:nil repeats:true];
}

-(void) submitBehaviouralData {
    [[AMBNManager sharedInstance] submitBehaviouralDataWithCompletion:^(AMBNResult *result, NSError *error) {
        NSNumber * score = result.score;
        //Do something with obtained score
    }];
}
```

## Getting the current score
To get the current session score from the server without sending any data use `getScoreWithCompletion` method from `AMBBManager`.

```objective_c
[[AMBNManager sharedInstance] getScoreWithCompletion:^(AMBNResult *result, NSError *error) {
  //Do something with the obtained score
}]
```

## Sensitive data protection
It is possible to protect sensitive data. There are two ways of doing it.

### Limiting
Sensitive view data capture limiting is achieved by calling the `addSensitiveViews:` method with an array of sensitive views. Events captured on these views do not contain absolute touch location and the view identifiers are salted using device specific random key. 

### Disabling
Disabled capturing of a view means absolutely no data will be collected about user activity connected with the view. Disabling means creating a `PrivacyGuard` object. It is required to store a strong reference to this object. Garbage collection of the privacy guard means that capturing will be enabled again.


>Capturing can be disabled for selected views. Array of protected views must be passed to `disableCapturingForViews` method.

```objective_c
- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];
    self.pinPrivacyGuard = [[AMBNManager sharedInstance] disableCapturingForViews:@[self.pinTextField]];
}
```


>Another option is to disable all views. Not data will be captured until `PrivacyGuard` is invalidated (or garbage collected)

```objective_c
- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];
    self.allViewsGuard = [[AMBNManager sharedInstance] disableCapturingForAllViews];
}
```



>Capturing can be re-enabled by calling `invalidate` method in the `PrivacyGuard` instance

```objective_c
- (void)onPinAccepted {
    [super viewDidLoad];
    [self.pinPrivacyGuard invalidate];
}
```
