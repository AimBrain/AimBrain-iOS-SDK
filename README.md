#AimBrain SDK integration

For full documentation and references please see: [https://docs.aimbrain.com](https://docs.aimbrain.com)

## Application class
In order to integrate the AimBrain iOS SDK it is necessary to set up `AMBNCapturingApplication` (subclass of `UIApplication`) as main application. `main.m` file after modification should look like this:

```objective_c
@import UIKit;
#import "MyAppDelegate.h"
#import "AMBNCapturingApplication.h"

int main(int argc, char * argv[]) {
    @autoreleasepool {
        return UIApplicationMain(argc, argv, NSStringFromClass([AMBNCapturingApplication class]), NSStringFromClass([MyAppDelegate class]));
    }
}
```

## API authentication
In order to communicate with the server, the application must be configured with a valid API Key and secret. Relevant configuration parameters should be passed to the SDK using the `AMBNManager`â€™s `configureWithApiKey:secret` method. Most often the best place for it is  `application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions` of app delegate.

```objective_c
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    [[AMBNManager sharedInstance] configureWithApiKey:@"test" secret:@"secret"];
    return YES;
}
```

# Request serialisation

AimBrain SDK can be used in two modes, by sending data to AimBrain API directly or by serialising requests and submitting the data via server side integration.

To serialise requests requiring active session `AMBNManager` has to be configured with session value.

```objective_c
[AMBNManager sharedInstance].session = <session value>
```

Once session is set methods with prefix ```getSerialized...``` can be called to retrieve serialized request data.  

All serialisation calls return ```AMBNSerializedRequest``` object. The request data can be accessed via ```AMBNSerializedRequest``` field ```data``` field as NSData or ```AMBNSerializedRequest``` field ```dataString``` as NSString.

Please refer to server side integration documentation for serialised data processing details.  

#Request metadata

For some integration scenarios additional data may be required to be sent to server.

Such integration-defined information should be submitted by calling function overload with parameter ```metadata```.

Integration-defined information is returned from server in response field ```metadata```.

# Sessions
In order to submit data to AimBrain `AMBNManager` needs to be configured with a session. There are two ways of doing it.

## Obtaining new session
A new session can be obtained by passing `userId` to `createSession` method on `AMBNManager`. Completion callback returns result object with session token, status of Facial Module modalitiy and status of Behavioural Module modality. Status of Facial Module modality (`result.face`) can have following values:

*0 - User not enrolled - facial authentication not available, enrollment required
*1 - User enrolled - facial authentication available.
*2 - Building template - enrollment done, AimBrain is building user template and no further action is required.

Status of Behavioural Module modality (`result.behaviour`) can have following  values:
*0 - User not enrolled - behavioural authentication not available, enrollment required.
*1 - User enrolled - behavioural authentication available.

```objective_c
[self.server createSessionWithUserId:userId completion:^(AMBNSessionCreateResult *result, NSError *error) {
    if(result){
      //Do something after successful session creation
    }
}];
```

The manager is automatically configured with the obtained session ID.

## Serialising new session call
To get serialised new session request use
```objective_c
AMBNSerializedRequest *request = [[AMBNManager sharedInstance] getSerializedCreateSessionWithUserId:userId metadata:metadata]
```

## Configuring with existing session
A session can be stored and later used to configure `AMBNManager`.

```objective_c
[AMBNManager sharedInstance].session = storedSession
```
# Behavioural module

## Registering views
The more views have identifiers assigned, the more accurate the analysis can be made. Views can be registered using `registerView:withId` method of `AMBNManager`

```objective_c
- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];

    [[AMBNManager sharedInstance] registerView:self.view withId:@"sign-in-vc"];
    [[AMBNManager sharedInstance] registerView:self.emailTextField withId:@"email-text-field"];
    [[AMBNManager sharedInstance] registerView:self.pinTextField withId:@"pin-text-field"];
    [[AMBNManager sharedInstance] registerView:self.wrongPINLabel withId:@"pin-label"];
}
```

## Starting collection
In order to start collecting behavioural data `start` method needs to be called on `AMBNManager`

```objective_c
[[AMBNManager sharedInstance] start];
```

## Submitting behavioural data
After the manager is configured with a session, behavioural data can be submitted.

```objective_c
[[AMBNManager sharedInstance] submitBehaviouralDataWithCompletion:^(AMBNBehaviouralResult *result, NSError *error) {
    NSNumber * score = result.score;
    //Do something with obtained score
}];
```

Server responds to data submission with the current behavioural score and status.

## Serialising behavioural data API call
To get serialised behavioural submission request use

```objective_c
AMBNSerializedRequest *request = [[AMBNManager sharedInstance] getSerializedSubmitBehaviouralDataWithMetadata:metadata]
```

### Periodic submission
In order to schedule periodic submission use the following snippet:

```objective_c
// Call this method after the session ID is obtained
- (void) startPeriodicUpdate {
   self.timer = [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:10.0f target: self selector:@selector(submitBehaviouralData) userInfo:nil repeats:true];
}

-(void) submitBehaviouralData {
    [[AMBNManager sharedInstance] submitBehaviouralDataWithCompletion:^(AMBNBehaviouralResult *result, NSError *error) {
        NSNumber * score = result.score;
        //Do something with obtained score
    }];
}
```

## Getting the current score
To get the current session score from the server without sending any data use `getScoreWithCompletion` method from `AMBBManager`.

```objective_c
[[AMBNManager sharedInstance] getScoreWithCompletion:^(AMBNBehaviouralResult *result, NSError *error) {
  // Do something with the obtained score
}]
```

## Serialising current score API call
To get serialised current score request use

```objective_c
AMBNSerializedRequest *request = [[AMBNManager sharedInstance] getSerializedGetScoreWithMetadata:metadata]
```

## Sensitive data protection
It is possible to protect sensitive data. There are two ways of doing it.

### Limiting
Sensitive view data capture limiting is achieved by calling the `addSensitiveViews:` method with an array of sensitive views. Events captured on these views do not contain absolute touch location and the view identifiers are salted using device specific random key.

### Disabling
Disabled capturing of a view means absolutely no data will be collected about user activity connected with the view. Disabling means creating a `PrivacyGuard` object. It is required to store a strong reference to this object. Garbage collection of the privacy guard means that capturing will be enabled again.

>Capturing can be disabled for selected views. Array of protected views must be passed to `disableCapturingForViews` method.

```objective_c
- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];
    self.pinPrivacyGuard = [[AMBNManager sharedInstance] disableCapturingForViews:@[self.pinTextField]];
}
```


>Another option is to disable all views. Not data will be captured until `PrivacyGuard` is invalidated (or garbage collected)

```objective_c
- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];
    self.allViewsGuard = [[AMBNManager sharedInstance] disableCapturingForAllViews];
}
```

>Capturing can be re-enabled by calling `invalidate` method in the `PrivacyGuard` instance

```objective_c
- (void)onPinAccepted {
    [super viewDidLoad];
    [self.pinPrivacyGuard invalidate];
}
```

# Facial module

## Taking pictures of the user's face
In order to take a picture of the user's face the `openFaceImagesCaptureWithTopHint` method has to be called from the `AMBNManager`. The camera view controller is then opened and completion block is called after user takes the picture and the view is dismissed.

```objective_c
[[AMBNManager sharedInstance] openFaceImagesCaptureWithTopHint:@"To authenticate please face the camera directly and press 'camera' button" bottomHint:@"Position your face fully within the outline with eyes between the lines." batchSize:3 delay:0.3 fromViewController:self completion:^(BOOL success, NSArray *images) {
    ...
}];
```

## Recording video of the user's face
In order to record video of the user's face the `instantiateFaceRecordingViewControllerWithVideoLength` method has to be called from the `AMBNManager`. The face recording view controller is return and needs to be presented. The face recording view controller has property `delegate` of type `AMBNFaceRecordingViewControllerDelegate`. It has to be set in order to receive video recording. After recording is finished `faceRecordingViewController:recordingResult:error:` method is called on the delegate. Video file is removed after this method returns.

```objective_c
AMBNFaceRecordingViewController *controller = [[AMBNManager sharedInstance] instantiateFaceRecordingViewControllerWithTopHint:@"Position your face fully within the outline with eyes between the lines." bottomHint:@"Position your face fully within the outline with eyes between the linessss." videoLength:2];
controller.delegate = self;
[self presentViewController:controller animated:YES completion:nil];
```

```objective_c
-(void)faceRecordingViewController:(AMBNFaceRecordingViewController *)faceRecordingViewController recordingResult:(NSURL *)video error:(NSError *)error {
    [faceRecordingViewController dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];
    // ... use video
}
```

## Authenticating with the facial module
In order to authenticate with facial module, the `authenticateFaceImages` or `authenticateFaceVideo` method has to be called from the `AMBNManager`. When using `authenticateFaceImages` an array with the images of the face has to passed as a parameter. When using `authenticateFaceVideo` an url of a video of the face has to be passed as parameter. The completion block is called with the score returned by the server, the score being between 0.0 and 1.0 and a liveliness rating, indicating if the photos or video taken were of a live person.

```objective_c
[[AMBNManager sharedInstance] authenticateFaceImages:images completion:^(AMBNAuthenticateResult *result, NSError *error) {
    ...
}];
```
```objective_c
[[AMBNManager sharedInstance] authenticateFaceVideo:video completion:^(AMBNAuthenticateResult *result, NSError *error) {
    ...
}];
```

## Serialising facial module authentication calls
To get serialised authentication requests use

```objective_c
AMBNSerializedRequest *request = [[AMBNManager sharedInstance] getSerializedAuthenticateFaceImages:images metadata:matadata];
```

```objective_c
AMBNSerializedRequest *request = [[AMBNManager sharedInstance] getSerializedAuthenticateFaceVideo:video metadata:matadata];
```

## Enrolling with the facial module
Enrolling with the facial module is done by calling the `enrollFaceImages` or `enrollFaceVideo` method from the `AMBNManager`. When using `enrollFaceImages` an array with with the images of the face has to passed as a parameter. When using `enrollFaceVideo` an url of a video of the face has to be passed as parameter. The completion block is called after the operation is finished. `result` field  `success` indicates if operation was successful, `imagesCount` indicates how many images were received, processed successfully and had a face in them.

```objective_c
[[AMBNManager sharedInstance] enrollFaceImages:images completion:^(AMBNEnrollFaceResult *result,  NSError *error) {
    ...
}];
```

```objective_c
[[AMBNManager sharedInstance] enrollFaceVideo:video completion:^(AMBNEnrollFaceResult *result, NSError *error) {
    ...
}];
```

## Serialising facial module enroll calls
To get serialised face enroll requests use

```objective_c
AMBNSerializedRequest *request = [[AMBNManager sharedInstance] getSerializedEnrollFaceImages:images metadata:matadata];
```

```objective_c
AMBNSerializedRequest *request = [[AMBNManager sharedInstance] getSerializedEnrollFaceVideo:video metadata:matadata];
```

## Comparing faces
Two batches of images of faces can be compared using the `compareFaceImages` method of the `AMBNManager`. The method takes an array of images of the first face and an array of images of the second face (arrays contain one or more images). The completion block is called with the result object containing similarity score and the liveliness ratings of both faces.
```objective_c
[[AMBNManager sharedInstance] compareFaceImages:firstFaceImages toFaceImages:secondFaceImages completion:^(AMBNCompareFaceResult *result, NSError *error) {
    ...
}];
```

## Serialising face compare call
To get serialised face compare request use
```objective_c
AMBNSerializedRequest *request = [[AMBNManager sharedInstance] getSerializedCompareFaceImages:firstFaceImages toFaceImages:secondFaceImages metadata:matadata];
```

# Voice module


## Retrieving voice token
In order to enroll or authenticate via voice module you have to record user voice and submit it to the API. Voice recording must contain user voice reading text retrieved with `getVoiceTokenWithType` method. Text retrieved with `getVoiceTokenWithType` is called `voice token` in the SDK.

```objective_c
AMBNVoiceTokenType type = AMBNVoiceTokenTypeAuth;
[[AMBNManager sharedInstance] getVoiceTokenWithType:type completionHandler:^(AMBNVoiceTextResult *result, NSError *error) {
    // ... result.tokenText contains voice token
}];
```

## Voice token types
Voice token retrieval method `getVoiceTokenWithType` takes mandatory `type` parameter.

All possible type values are defined in the enum `AMBNVoiceTokenType`:
* Tokens with type `AMBNVoiceTokenTypeAuth` are used for authentication calls.
* Tokens with types `AMBNVoiceTokenTypeEnroll1`, `AMBNVoiceTokenTypeEnroll2`, `AMBNVoiceTokenTypeEnroll3`, `AMBNVoiceTokenTypeEnroll4`, `AMBNVoiceTokenTypeEnroll5` are used for enrollment.

To complete enrollment voice tokens must be retrieved with each enroll type used for enrollment (`AMBNVoiceTokenTypeEnrollN`). Each voice token must be presented to the user, recorded and enrolled successfully.

## Serialising voice token call
To get serialised voice token request use

```objective_c
AMBNSerializedRequest *request = [[AMBNManager sharedInstance] getSerializedGetVoiceTokenWithType:type metadata:matadata];
```

## Recording user voice
In order to record user voice the `instantiateVoiceRecordingViewControllerWithTopHint` method has to be called from the `AMBNManager`. The voice recording view controller is returned and needs to be presented. The voice recording view controller has property `delegate` of type `AMBNVoiceRecordingViewControllerDelegate`. It has to be set in order to receive audio recording. After recording is finished `voiceRecordingViewController:recordingResult:error:` method is called on the delegate. Audio file is removed after this method returns.

Voice token retrieved with `getVoiceTokenWithType` or `getSerializedGetVoiceTokenWithType:metadata:` must be passed as `recordingHint` parameter. This text will be presented to the user with voice recording instructions.

```objective_c
AMBNVoiceRecordingViewController *vc = [[AMBNManager sharedInstance] instantiateVoiceRecordingViewControllerWithTopHint:hint bottomHint:bottomHint recordingHint:text audioLength:5];
vc.delegate = self;
[self.viewController presentViewController:vc animated:YES completion:nil];
```

```objective_c
- (void)voiceRecordingViewController:(AMBNVoiceRecordingViewController *)voiceRecordingViewController recordingResult:(NSURL *)audio error:(NSError *)error {
    [voiceRecordingViewController dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:^{}];
    // ... use audio
}
```

## Authenticating with the voice module
In order to authenticate with voice module, the `authenticateVoice` method has to be called from the `AMBNManager`. An url of recorded audio file with user voice has to be passed as parameter. The completion block is called with the score returned by the server, the score being between 0.0 and 1.0 and a liveliness rating, indicating if the voice recorded was of a live person.

```objective_c
[[AMBNManager sharedInstance] authenticateVoice:voice completion:^(AMBNAuthenticateResult *result, NSError *error) {
    ...
}];
```
